// Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

// For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

// Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

// Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

// Example 1:

// Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
// Output: true
// Example 2:

// Input: root1 = [1,2,3], root2 = [1,3,2]
// Output: false

// Constraints:

// The number of nodes in each tree will be in the range [1, 200].
// Both of the given trees will have values in the range [0, 200].
